# build-system-for-python3-in-sublime-text-3
it is just a basic code for sublime text 3 in which its very tedius to  build system for python basically python 3 and other upgraded versions
so i went through this issue when i switched myself from c++ to python.
This is very helpfull for the the newbies who are going to build their program or project either ot it be django project as well.
so enjoy the charm of the code.
cheers
